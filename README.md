The code for my Honours Project

My Honours Project: How do users prefer to upload media onto a server from a UX perspective?

The code here is for a site that allows 2 different upload methods for testing which users prefer.

The point of this project is to measure upload methods by getting users to test and record their results in UEQ.

This project is public incase markers require access to my code.
